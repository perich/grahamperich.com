# Agentic Coding On-the-Go

The Claude iOS app gives you the ability to use Claude Code on the go. It works fine, but it doesn't run on _my_ computer which makes it significantly less useful. I want to start working at my desk, leave the house, and pick up the exact same conversation from my phone while waiting in line somewhere. Turns out this is very doable with three tools: tmux, Tailscale, and Termius.

The setup takes ~30 minutes. When you're done, you'll be able to seamlessly transition from coding at home to coding on-the-go via remote connection to your primary Mac workstation.

### 1. tmux (Persistent Terminal Sessions)

tmux is a terminal multiplexer—it keeps your shell sessions alive even when you disconnect. This is the foundation of the whole setup.

<ResponsiveContainer>
  <CodeBlock language="bash" code={`brew install tmux`} />
</ResponsiveContainer>

The core commands you need:

<ResponsiveContainer>
  <CodeBlock language="bash" code={`# Create a new named session
tmux new -s coding

# Start Claude Code inside the session
claude

# Detach from session (keeps it running)
# Press: Ctrl+B, then D

# List all sessions
tmux ls

# Reattach to a session
tmux attach -t coding

# Kill a session when done
tmux kill-session -t coding`} />
</ResponsiveContainer>

I use descriptive session names for different projects: `tmux new -s website-redesign` or `tmux new -s api-refactor`. Simple but effective.

#### Making tmux Survive Reboots

With the right plugins, tmux sessions persist across Mac restarts. This is very nice so that you don't have to stress about restarts, crashes, laptop running out of battery, etc.. when you open tmux again, everything will be restored.

Install TPM (tmux plugin manager):

<ResponsiveContainer>
  <CodeBlock language="bash" code={`git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm`} />
</ResponsiveContainer>

Create `~/.tmux.conf`:

<ResponsiveContainer>
  <CodeBlock language="bash" code={`# List of TPM plugins
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tpm'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum'

# Continuum: autosave + autorestore
set -g @continuum-restore 'on'
set -g @continuum-save-interval '5'

# Initialize TPM (keep this at the bottom of plugin section)
run '~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/tpm'

# Enable mouse support for intuitive scrolling on iPhone via Termius!
set -g mouse on`} />
</ResponsiveContainer>

Then start tmux and press `Ctrl+B, Shift+I` to install plugins. Sessions now auto-save every 5 minutes and auto-restore on reboot.

### 2. Tailscale (Access Your Mac From Anywhere)

Tailscale creates a mesh VPN between your devices. Once set up, your iPhone can SSH into your home Mac from anywhere—coffee shop, airport, hotel—as if you were on the same LAN. No port forwarding, no dynamic DNS nonsense.

Setup:
1. Download from <a href="https://tailscale.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tailscale.com/download</a>
2. Sign in (Google, GitHub, etc.)
3. Your Mac gets a Tailscale IP (100.x.x.x range)

Enable SSH on your Mac:
1. Open **System Settings**
2. Go to **General** → **Sharing**
3. Turn on **Remote Login**

Find your Tailscale IP:

<ResponsiveContainer>
  <CodeBlock language="bash" code={`tailscale ip -4
# Example output: 100.101.102.103`} />
</ResponsiveContainer>

Tailscale also provides Magic DNS—you can SSH to `your-mac-hostname` instead of the IP. 

After you've installed Tailscale on your Mac and setup an account, go install Tailscale on your <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tailscale/id1470499037" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone and iPad</a> too and sign in. All devices on the same account see each other, as long as they're connected to Tailscale.

One thing to note: your Mac needs to stay awake for this to work. I use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sleep-control-centre/id946798523?mt=12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sleep Control Centre</a> to prevent it from sleeping when I'm away.

### 3. Termius (SSH From Your Phone)

Termius is a great SSH client for iOS.

- **iPhone/iPad**: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/termius-modern-ssh-client/id549039908" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Store</a>

Create a new host with your Tailscale IP (or Magic DNS name), your Mac username, and SSH key auth. Use SSH keys, not passwords—generate with `ssh-keygen`, copy with `ssh-copy-id`. If you don't know how to do this, send this entire blog post to an AI chatbot and ask them to walk you through it ;)

### The Workflow

At home:

<ResponsiveContainer>
  <CodeBlock language="bash" code={`tmux new -s myproject
cd ~/projects/my-awesome-app
claude

# Work with Claude...

# Need to leave? Detach:
# Ctrl+B, then D

# Close terminal. Leave house.`} />
</ResponsiveContainer>

On-the-go (from iPhone):

<ResponsiveContainer>
  <CodeBlock language="bash" code={`# Open Termius → tap "Home Mac" → you're in

tmux attach -t myproject

# You're back. Claude remembers everything.`} />
</ResponsiveContainer>

That's it. The session is exactly where you left it.

### Misc Tips

**Multiple sessions**: Run `tmux new -s website`, `tmux new -s api`, etc. List with `tmux ls`, attach with `tmux attach -t name`.

**Mac sleeping?** I use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sleep-control-centre/id946798523?mt=12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sleep Control Centre</a> to keep it awake.
