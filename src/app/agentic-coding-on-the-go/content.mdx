<div className="flex flex-col gap-2 my-6 self-start">
  <div className="text-blue-400 text-lg font-medium">Code Anywhere, Anytime</div>
  <div className="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 italic text-gray-400">How I use tmux, Tailscale, and Termius to maintain persistent Claude Code sessions across devices and locations</div>
</div>

### The Problem

You're working on something with Claude Code at your desk. You've got a great flow going, the AI is understanding your codebase, and you're making real progress. Then life happens—you need to leave the house, run an errand, or catch a flight. Your coding session ends, and when you return later, you have to start fresh, re-explaining context and losing that momentum.

What if you could just... pick up exactly where you left off, from anywhere?

<BlogNote type="info" title="The Magic">
With tmux, Tailscale, and Termius, you can start a Claude Code session at home, detach, leave your house, and seamlessly reattach from your iPhone or MacBook while you're out. Your AI coding assistant remembers everything, the conversation continues, and your workflow never breaks.
</BlogNote>

### Why This Setup is Game-Changing

Before we dive into the how, let me explain why this is so incredibly useful:

1. **Persistent AI Context**: Claude Code maintains its full conversation history and understanding of your codebase. No re-explaining, no lost context.

2. **True Mobility**: Start work at your desk, continue from a coffee shop, finish from a hotel room—all with the same session.

3. **Zero Interruption**: Your code execution, file watchers, development servers—everything keeps running even when you disconnect.

4. **Multi-Device Flexibility**: Access from your MacBook, iPad, or even your iPhone when you just need to check on progress.

5. **Network Independence**: Tailscale creates a secure mesh network, so you're always connected to your home machine as if you were on the same LAN.

### Step 1: Setting Up tmux

tmux is a terminal multiplexer that lets you create persistent sessions. Even when you disconnect, the session keeps running in the background.

#### Install tmux

<ResponsiveContainer>
  <CodeBlock language="bash" code={`brew install tmux`} />
</ResponsiveContainer>

#### Basic tmux Commands

<ResponsiveContainer>
  <CodeBlock language="bash" code={`# Create a new named session
tmux new -s coding

# Start Claude Code inside the session
claude

# Detach from session (keeps it running)
# Press: Ctrl+B, then D

# List all sessions
tmux ls

# Reattach to a session
tmux attach -t coding

# Kill a session when done
tmux kill-session -t coding`} />
</ResponsiveContainer>

<BlogNote type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
I like to create descriptive session names for different projects: `tmux new -s website-redesign` or `tmux new -s api-refactor`. This makes it easy to manage multiple ongoing projects.
</BlogNote>

#### Make tmux Survive Reboots

Here's the killer feature: with the right plugins, your tmux sessions can survive reboots! This means even if your Mac restarts, your sessions are automatically restored.

We'll use **TPM** (tmux plugin manager) along with two essential plugins:
- **tmux-resurrect**: Saves and restores tmux sessions
- **tmux-continuum**: Automatic continuous saving and restoring

#### Install TPM (tmux plugin manager)

<ResponsiveContainer>
  <CodeBlock language="bash" code={`git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm`} />
</ResponsiveContainer>

#### Configure ~/.tmux.conf

Create or edit `~/.tmux.conf` with this configuration:

<ResponsiveContainer>
  <CodeBlock language="bash" code={`# List of TPM plugins
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tpm'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum'

# Continuum: autosave + autorestore
set -g @continuum-restore 'on'
set -g @continuum-save-interval '5'

# Initialize TPM (keep this at the bottom of plugin section)
run '~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/tpm'

# Enable mouse support for intuitive scrolling on iPhone via Termius!
set -g mouse on`} />
</ResponsiveContainer>

#### Install the Plugins

<ResponsiveContainer>
  <CodeBlock language="bash" code={`# Start tmux
tmux

# Inside tmux, press: Ctrl+B, then Shift+I (capital I)
# This will install all plugins listed in your config

# You should see a message: "TMUX environment reloaded"
# Your plugins are now installed!`} />
</ResponsiveContainer>

<BlogNote type="info" title="What This Does">
With this setup, tmux will automatically save your sessions every 5 minutes. If your Mac reboots, restarts, or crashes, when you start tmux again, all your sessions—including your Claude Code conversations—will be automatically restored. It's magical!
</BlogNote>

### Step 2: Setting Up Tailscale

Tailscale creates a secure mesh VPN between all your devices. Once set up, you can SSH into your home machine from anywhere as if you were on the same local network.

#### Install Tailscale on Your Mac

1. Visit <a href="https://tailscale.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tailscale.com/download</a>
2. Download and install the macOS app
3. Sign in with your preferred account (Google, GitHub, etc.)
4. Your Mac will get a Tailscale IP address (usually in the 100.x.x.x range)

#### Enable SSH on Your Mac

1. Open **System Settings**
2. Go to **General** → **Sharing**
3. Turn on **Remote Login**

That's it—your Mac is now accepting SSH connections.

#### Note Your Tailscale IP

<ResponsiveContainer>
  <CodeBlock language="bash" code={`# Find your Tailscale IP
tailscale ip -4

# Example output: 100.101.102.103`} />
</ResponsiveContainer>

<BlogNote type="info" title="Magic DNS">
Tailscale also provides Magic DNS, so you can use your machine's hostname instead of the IP. For example, if your Mac is named "graham-macbook", you can SSH to `graham-macbook` instead of the IP address!
</BlogNote>

#### Install Tailscale on Other Devices

Install Tailscale on any device you want to connect from:
- Your MacBook
- Your iPhone
- Your iPad

All devices signed into your Tailscale account will be able to see each other on the mesh network.

### Step 3: Setting Up Termius

Termius is a beautiful, modern SSH client that works on macOS and iOS. It syncs your connections across devices.

#### Install Termius

- **Mac**: Download from <a href="https://termius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">termius.com</a>
- **iPhone/iPad**: Download from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/termius-modern-ssh-client/id549039908" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Store</a>

#### Create an SSH Connection

1. Open Termius
2. Click "New Host"
3. Enter details:
   - **Label**: Home Mac (or whatever you prefer)
   - **Address**: Your Tailscale IP (e.g., `100.101.102.103`) or Magic DNS name
   - **Username**: Your Mac username
   - **Authentication**: Password or SSH key

<BlogNote type="warning" title="Security Tip">
I highly recommend using SSH keys instead of passwords. Generate a key with `ssh-keygen` and add it to your Mac with `ssh-copy-id`. Termius makes it easy to import and manage SSH keys.
</BlogNote>

#### Sync Across Devices

Termius has a premium tier that syncs your hosts, keys, and snippets across all devices. This is incredibly convenient—set up your connection once, access it from anywhere.

### Putting It All Together: The Workflow

Now for the magic. Here's my typical workflow:

#### At Home (Starting the Session)

<ResponsiveContainer>
  <CodeBlock language="bash" code={`# 1. Start a new tmux session
tmux new -s myproject

# 2. Navigate to your project
cd ~/projects/my-awesome-app

# 3. Start Claude Code
claude

# 4. Start working with Claude
# (Have a conversation, write code, run tests, etc.)

# 5. Need to leave? Just detach!
# Press: Ctrl+B, then D

# Your session is now running in the background.
# Close your terminal. Turn off your monitor. Leave the house!`} />
</ResponsiveContainer>

#### On-the-Go (Reconnecting)

Pull out your iPhone, iPad, or MacBook:

<ResponsiveContainer>
  <CodeBlock language="bash" code={`# 1. Open Termius
# 2. Tap/click your "Home Mac" connection
# 3. You're in! Now reattach to tmux:

tmux attach -t myproject

# BOOM! You're back exactly where you left off.
# Claude remembers everything. Your code is there.
# Continue the conversation like nothing happened.`} />
</ResponsiveContainer>

### Real-World Use Cases

Let me share some scenarios where this has been incredibly useful:

**The Coffee Shop Continuation**: Started refactoring a complex authentication system at home. Claude was deep into understanding the flow. Had to meet a friend at a coffee shop. Pulled out my iPad, reconnected via Termius, and continued the refactoring session while sipping a latte.

**The Airport Debugging**: Was on a flight when I remembered I needed to check on a deployment. Used my phone with Termius, reattached to my tmux session, asked Claude to review the logs, identified the issue, and pushed a fix—all from seat 22A.

**The Multi-Location Sprint**: Working on a tight deadline, I started at home, continued from a coworking space, finished from a friend's house. Same Claude session the entire time. The AI had full context of all the decisions we'd made throughout the day.

**The Background Build**: Started a large build process with Claude monitoring it. Detached and went for a run. Came back an hour later, reattached, and Claude had the full output ready for me to review.

### Advanced Tips

#### Multiple Sessions

You can run multiple tmux sessions for different projects:

<ResponsiveContainer>
  <CodeBlock language="bash" code={`tmux new -s website
tmux new -s api
tmux new -s scripts

# List all sessions
tmux ls

# Attach to specific session
tmux attach -t api`} />
</ResponsiveContainer>

#### tmux Windows and Panes

Create multiple windows within a session:

<ResponsiveContainer>
  <CodeBlock language="bash" code={`# Create new window: Ctrl+B, then C
# Switch windows: Ctrl+B, then 0-9
# Split pane horizontally: Ctrl+B, then "
# Split pane vertically: Ctrl+B, then %
# Navigate panes: Ctrl+B, then arrow keys`} />
</ResponsiveContainer>

I often run Claude Code in one window, and have another window for running tests or monitoring logs.

#### Tailscale Exit Nodes

Tailscale can also route your entire internet connection through another device. If you're on sketchy public WiFi, you can route through your home connection for extra security.

#### SSH Config Shortcuts

Create an SSH config file for even faster connections:

<ResponsiveContainer>
  <CodeBlock language="bash" code={`# ~/.ssh/config
Host home
    HostName 100.101.102.103
    User graham
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Now you can just: ssh home`} />
</ResponsiveContainer>

### Why This Matters for Agentic Coding

Claude Code isn't just a chatbot—it's a coding partner that understands your project, your patterns, and your goals. But that understanding builds up over a conversation. Every time you start fresh, you lose that accumulated context.

With this setup:
- **Context Preservation**: Claude remembers every decision, every file it's seen, every pattern you've discussed
- **Long-Running Tasks**: Let Claude work on refactoring, testing, or analysis while you're away
- **Flexibility**: Your best ideas don't always happen at your desk
- **Continuity**: Pick up mid-thought, mid-implementation, mid-debugging

The combination of persistent sessions (tmux), secure remote access (Tailscale), and excellent SSH clients (Termius) creates something magical: truly location-independent development with a persistent AI partner.

### Final Thoughts

This setup has genuinely transformed how I work. I no longer feel tied to my desk or anxious about interruptions. I can start something, let it simmer, come back to it from anywhere, and continue seamlessly.

The initial setup takes maybe 30 minutes, but the freedom it provides is immeasurable. Whether you're a digital nomad, a busy parent who codes in stolen moments, or just someone who appreciates flexibility—this workflow is a game-changer.

<BlogNote type="tip" title="Try It Today">
Start simple: install tmux, create a session, detach, and reattach. Once you see how satisfying it is to pick up exactly where you left off, you'll be hooked. Then add Tailscale and Termius to unlock the full mobile potential.
